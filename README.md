# My solutions to [Advent of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017) problems

1. Inverse captcha - Julia
   * Indices starting at one
   * Unit test inline are cool
2. Corruption checksum - F#
3. Spiral memory - Lox (1st part) https://oeis.org/A141481 (2nd part)
   * Problem actually solved with pen and paper (and maths)
   * Having a standard library helps
   * Sometimes there is no need to code
4. High entropy passwords - Perl
5. A Maze of Twisty Trampolines, All Alike - Lua
6. Memory reallocation - Elm
   * Probably not the best language to work with arrays, but that's feasible
7. Recursive circus - Crystal
   * Typed languages with Ruby-like syntax are nice
8. I heard you like registers - Nim
9. Stream processing - C
10. Knot hash - R
11. Hex ed - Javascript
12. Digital plumber - PHP
12. Packet scanners - bash/awk
   * The solution to the second part is extremely slow. I also coded a faster solution in Python
